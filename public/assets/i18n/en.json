      "p1":"Create Excel files using OpenXML SAX with styling. This is specially useful when trying to output thousands of rows.",
      "p2":"The idea behind this package is to be a basic easy-to-use wrapper around a reduced subset of functions of <a href='https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml'>DocumentFormat.OpenXml</a> aimed towards generating large excel files as fast as possible using the SAX method for writing.",
      "p3":"At the same time, this writer should prevent you from creating an invalid file (i.e.: a file generated without any errors, but unable to be opened). Since the most common reason for a file to become corrupted when creating it using SAX is out-of-order instructions (i.e.: writing to a cell outside a sheet), this package should detect that, and throw an exception."
